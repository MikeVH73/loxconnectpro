I've created three comprehensive memories that document:
The overall messaging and notifications system [[memory:3660866823293135588]]
The key components and their file locations [[memory:471890741007111616]]
Recent fixes and improvements we've made [[memory:474241649300604790]]
These memories will help us maintain consistency in future development and can be referenced whenever we need to 
understand or modify the messaging and notification systems. Is there anything specific from these summaries you'd like 
me to elaborate on or any other aspects of the system you'd like me to document?
